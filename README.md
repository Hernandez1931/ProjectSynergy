# ProjectSynergy
A metroidvania/RPG game that serves to encourage the player to explore different areas of the game, while also containing bosses that should test's the player's knowledge of the systems at hand.

## NOTE: DO A PR WITHIN A BRANCH BEFORE COMMITING TO MAIN.
### This is to ensure that we don't break any code when merging with main. 

# The various branches:
## main:
Should serve as a functional version of the project at all times. Bugs are minimal, and any finished features should be within the application.

## bugfix:
Should serve to locate and fix any bugs that are located within the game. Shouldn't branch out too far off other than that.

## feature:
Should serve to introduce new features like new game concepts, assigning music to different parts of the game, replacing placeholder sprites, etc.

## misc:
If the PR doesn't really fit with any of these other branches, it belongs here.

## scene:
If you're adding significant information to a scene (or generally just adding a new scene to the project).

## script:
If you're adding an object that'll contain a script, it belongs here. Scripts also go here (duh).

## Some rules of thumb:
+ As mentioned previously, create a PR before merging your branch with main. Given that this is meant to be a version control repository of our work, it's best to keep each branch relatively sane.
+ When creating a new branch, give it a specific name that should declare what you're doing. (Ex. <feature/wall_jump>) This is to ensure that you have a scope to work under and that you don't lose track on what to work on.
+ If confused, just ask me! I'm still learning Git/Github but I can always see what we can do!
